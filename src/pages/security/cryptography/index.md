## Cryptography

Cryptography is the art of changing information in a way that if it is read by a person who doesnt have the key to read it, the message is unreadable.
Cryptography started being used by the romans in order to make messages in battle unreadable by the enemy if decyphered. 
Modern cryptography is used in data so that only one party or only authorised partys have the ability to access the information.
