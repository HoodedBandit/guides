## Cryptography

Cryptography is the art of changing information in a way that if it is read by a person who doesn't have the key to read it, the message is unreadable.
Cryptography started being used by the Romans in order to make messages in battle unreadable by the enemy if decyphered. 
Modern cryptography is used in data so that only one party or only authorised partys have the ability to access the information. 

Encryption over  the years has become more advanced.
The first known cypher was the Cesar cypher.
The Cesar cypher worked by shifting the letters of the word by a specific ammount up or down in the alphabet. 
From a random persons perspective, the message was just a jumble of letters with random spaces in beetween .
Modern encryption is randomied numbers and letters and it takes time to generate as well as cracking. 
Cracking modern encryption EVEN WITH THE BEST computers on the market. 
Can and WILL take hundreds of thousands of years.
